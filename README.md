Aerofit is a leading brand in the field of fitness equipment. Aerofit provides a product range including machines such as treadmills, exercise bikes, gym equipment, and fitness accessories to cater to the needs of all categories of people.


## Business Problem

The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.
For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.

## Recommendations:
1. We can add some features in treadmills that will be useful for women to attract more women consumers
2. We can start a new campaign with a national women's runner icon to promote treadmills to women
3. As there are more features and functionality in the KP781 model and its cost is higher than the other two models, we can promote this model to customers with higher income groups and athletes
4. We can sponsor national-level sports events to promote the KP781 model to athletes and aspiring athletes, it will also increase sales and revenue.
5. We can add a 'Streak' feature in a treadmill, which will help to improve the consistency of users.
6. We can run a TV advertisement, that will depict the health benefits of regular walking and running; like it will help improve diabetes, and high BP (which may help increase customers above the 50 age group). The advertisement will also mention that if users have a treadmill then he/she can exercise daily irrespective of outside weather conditions.
